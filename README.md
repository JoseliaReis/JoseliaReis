# ðŸ‘‹ Hi all :)

My name is Joselia Reis, I am 30 years old, from Brazil. 
I am currently studying the Higher Diploma in Science in Computing at NCI having previously graduated as a Lawyer in Brazil in 2016 where I worked for three years, practising labour and consumer law. In 2019 I decided to move to Ireland to learn English and improve my career.
After finishing my first 8 months studying English, I decided to go back into third level to study Computer Science. I am very interested in combining my expertise in law and my growing skills in IT within the realm of Data Analyst, Business Analyst, Data Engineer, Data Science and data vizualization.


Would you like to find me?
