# ðŸ‘‹ Hi all :)
My name is Joselia Reis, I am 30 years old, from Brazil. 
I am currently studying the Higher Diploma in Science in Computing at NCI having previously graduated as a Lawyer in Brazil in 2016 where I worked for three years, practising labour and consumer law. In 2019 I decided to move to Ireland to learn English and improve my career.
After finishing my first 8 months studying English, I decided to go back into third level to study Computer Science. I am very interested in combining my expertise in law and my growing skills in IT within the realm of Data Analyst, Business Analyst, Data Engineer, Data Science and data vizualization.
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in read books, go for walk, swuiming, music and movies. 

Would you like to find me?
